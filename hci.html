                                    In the class Human Computer Interaction, I worked with three students, Wesley Yang, Khizar Qureshi, and Sho Tanaka in order
                                    to create an application that would solve a problem here at Carleton College. We decided to focus on waste reduction as well as 
                                    providing opportunities for all individuals to get items necessary for college students. To do so we decided to create an 
                                    application in which students can buy, sell, or trade items. This provides opportunities for students to get lightly used items
                                    that would normally be thrown away, from other students at cheap, affordable pricing. This project will help individuals that are 
                                    possibly struggling with trasnportation or financial burderns in order to get items that they need for college.

                        After the first prototype of our figma application, we used fictional inquiry interviews in order to have a better understanding
                        of what users want from our website through a UX process. Through a six step analysis process that included Initial axial coding, affinity diagram, 
                        creating a codebook, axial coding with our codebook, consensus building, and requirements generation, we were able to diagnose 
                        exactly what users were looking for in our application as well as how to apply them to our prototype. After such inquiries we
                        were able to then continue with out prototyping with three requirements of what we should add to our prototypes.
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Our analysis process included creating an initiala axial code, which was encoding interview transcripts of relevant passages. Then
                        Creating an affinity diagram that held each of those axial encodings which we then created a codebook out of. This code book served
                        as a key for us to look at and make decisions on what we needed to change and add. We then did consensus building where we all agreed 
                        on the best code and passages. Finally moving to requirement generations which are explained next. These steps can be seen in the
                        axial codebook linked below!
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        From these inquiries, we identified our final three requirements: a Buy Page, Shopping Cart Page, and Sell Page. The Buy Page 
                        serves as the main platform for browsing and purchasing items, featuring tools like a filter button for easier navigation. The 
                        Shopping Cart Page lets users store items they’re interested in purchasing, avoiding the need to buy each item separately. The 
                        Sell Page provides a space for users to upload pictures, descriptions, and seller information, with features like payment type 
                        options. Prototype II both creates these pages as well as a way to navigate between them, making sure users can use the full
                        extent of our application. It utilizes well known icons and images as buttons and indicators for different pages and some text
                        withint pages to ensure users know what does what!

                        After the first several prototypes, our group continued to use UX evaluations in order to coninually improve our application. 
                        To do so, we performed several interviews aiming at gaining statistical UX metrics that would give us hints at what is working well
                        and what we can improve. In a quick overview, the improvements I found for my prototype included improved highlighting and contrast of buttons,
                        an improved color scheme that would help highlighting buttons, and improving the flow programming so there is a more intuitive movement 
                        between pages. During the interview, my interviewees highlighted that they liked the simplicity of the page. Afterall a shopping application
                        should not have the colorful attractiveness of a social media application. They also highlighted that they liked most of the flow functionality, 
                        saying that most of it was intuitive and easy, even if the buttons were not very clear. Lastly, they liked that there was not an abundance of
                        complicated information quickly, rather it was spread out over many pages. 
                        
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        In order to incorporate the information that I gained from the UX evaluation, I changed several aspects of prototype II. The first thing I changed was 
                        color scheme. Due to the darker background, it was difficult to see the black buttons, as highlighted in the previous paragraph. I changed the background 
                        to be white so that the black buttons would stand out much more! The second thing I changed was the flow functionality. Instead of having many complicated 
                        flows that led in loops, I aimed for a simpler design that has more deadends that you navigate backwards from. This greatly improved the intuition of the flow. 
                        Also to this point, I made titles of pages more clear, such as emphasizing "profile" on the profile page. Lastly, I added a slight flair of color in the name near 
                        the top of each page. As highlighted by my interviewees, the store should not be overly colorful since it is just for shopping, but should have something colorful
                        in order to remember the application by.
                        
                    <p>

                    <p>
                       For our UX evaluation for the third prototype, I chose to use think-aloud and co-discovery. In this type of interview, I ask two or more senior Carleton students to
                       use my prototype while I ask them to do specific tasks, pointed questions, and point out mistakes. The interviewees job is to use the application while speaking their thoughts, 
                       giving me important insights into what they think about specific aspects of the application. For example, a task that I asked an interviewee to complete was to "navigate from 
                       the home page to the buy page and back to the home page." I would then take note of the amount of time on the task, considering any spoken thoughts they had about the process. 
                       I also asked them to rate my application, recorded number of errors, and overall user navigation patterns. All of these statistics helped me improve my prototype!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In order to successfully complete co-discovery think-aloud sessions, I came up with UX metrics I wanted to collect and several tasks that would help me collect those 
                        UX metrics. The UX metrics I decided to collect were overall ratings of the application, number of errors, time on task, and user navigation patterns. Overall ratings 
                        were the easiest to collect, requiring only a simple question of what the interviewee rated the question at the end of the interview (I unfortunatley forgot to 
                        record these questions, but got the ratings just after interviewing my subjects). However for the rest of the UX metrics I had to ask for specific tasks in order to collect 
                        them. The first task I asked them to do was to open the application and navigate from the home page to the buy page. This was completed before any familiarity of the application
                        and seperately between the two subjects. I collected the time on task, number of errors that occured, and any general user naviagation patterns. Errors were defined as any click 
                        that did not directly help them navigate to the buy page or to the home page, while general user naviagtion patterns were decided if both subjects performed similar errors or actions.
                        Similar to the previous task, I then asked the interviewees to navigate from the home page to the settings page and then to the upload page. Similar metrics were measured, however 
                        this test was looking specifically at the flow between pages that were not the home page. Finally the last task I asked them to do was to navigate to a page of their choosing and 
                        then navigate to two other pages of their choosing. Similar metrics were measured. 
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After performing the co-discover think-aloud session, I was able to look at the statistics that I measured. The first statistic that I considered was the subject rating of the 
                        application. One use rated it a 3/5 due to the application being "You know, ... too bland,". However, they later remarked that too much color may be distracting from the "main 
                        purpose of it (CarlMart), it's not like a social media,". The other subject rate the application as a 4/5 citing that there "was a good use of negative space" however there needed 
                        to be more "flow interactions between pages you're on,". Due to this 3.5/5 rating, I tried to use their comments on why they rated the application as such in order to improve the 
                        prototype by adding some more color, changin the background color, and improving flow interactions.  I then considered the number of mistakes found on task 1. There was an average 
                        of 4.5 mistakes from the subjects, showing that there was little intuition between 
                        opening the application and using it. Subjects cited the mistakes due to the fact "it's kind of hard to see the icons." These icons were the buttons so I concluded that I needed to 
                        improve the contrast of the buttons and the background. The time on task was averaged at 23 seconds (rounded) which also gave me a hint that there was low intuition for the task. 
                        Additionally, both subject cited difficulty to see buttons as the reason for the difficulty, showing that there was a common navigation pattern. After this task, I asked the subjects 
                        to perform the other two tasks I outlined ealier. All results from both the subjects thoughts and the statistics, led to very similar conclusions that I had already found.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As far as the future of this application, there were several other improvement that I was unable to complete with this prototype. Subjects suggested adding a log-in page that I was 
                        unable to design for this prototype. This would add a feature of security and assurance that users of CarlMart would be Carleton Students. Subjects cited this as a very important 
                        distinction for users of the application to feel safe. Additionally, I would like to conduct axial code on the transcripts of my co-discovery think aloud interview as well as my 
                        teammates inteviews in order to find additional improvements and features for the application. As a team, we would also like to talk about Carleton staff in order to 
                        advertise the application to Carleton Students. Another thing my interviewees suggested that my group memebers had not thought about was to have a bidding option, in which 
                        users of the application could enter bids on items rather than having a set price.
