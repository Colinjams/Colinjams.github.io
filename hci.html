                                    In the class Human Computer Interaction, I worked with three students, Wesley Yang, Khizar Qureshi, and Sho Tanaka in order
                                    to create an application that would solve a problem here at Carleton College. We decided to focus on waste reduction as well as 
                                    providing opportunities for all individuals to get items necessary for college students. To do so we decided to create an 
                                    application in which students can buy, sell, or trade items. This provides opportunities for students to get lightly used items
                                    that would normally be thrown away, from other students at cheap, affordable pricing. This project will help individuals that are 
                                    possibly struggling with trasnportation or financial burderns in order to get items that they need for college.

                    <p>
                        After the first prototype of our figma application, we used fictional inquiry interviews in order to have a better understanding
                        of what users want from our website through a UX process. Through a six step analysis process that included Initial axial coding, affinity diagram, 
                        creating a codebook, axial coding with our codebook, consensus building, and requirements generation, we were able to diagnose 
                        exactly what users were looking for in our application as well as how to apply them to our prototype. After such inquiries we
                        were able to then continue with out prototyping with three requirements of what we should add to our prototypes.
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        Our analysis process included creating an initiala axial code, which was encoding interview transcripts of relevant passages. Then
                        Creating an affinity diagram that held each of those axial encodings which we then created a codebook out of. This code book served
                        as a key for us to look at and make decisions on what we needed to change and add. We then did consensus building where we all agreed 
                        on the best code and passages. Finally moving to requirement generations which are explained next. These steps can be seen in the
                        axial codebook linked below!
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        From these inquiries, we identified our final three requirements: a Buy Page, Shopping Cart Page, and Sell Page. The Buy Page 
                        serves as the main platform for browsing and purchasing items, featuring tools like a filter button for easier navigation. The 
                        Shopping Cart Page lets users store items they’re interested in purchasing, avoiding the need to buy each item separately. The 
                        Sell Page provides a space for users to upload pictures, descriptions, and seller information, with features like payment type 
                        options. Prototype II both creates these pages as well as a way to navigate between them, making sure users can use the full
                        extent of our application. It utilizes well known icons and images as buttons and indicators for different pages and some text
                        withint pages to ensure users know what does what!

                        After the first several prototypes, our group continued to use UX evaluations in order to coninually improve our application. 
                        To do so, we performed several interviews aiming at gaining statistical UX metrics that would give us hints at what is working well
                        and what we can improve. In a quick overview, the improvements I found for my prototype included improved highlighting and contrast of buttons,
                        an improved color scheme that would help highlighting buttons, and improving the flow programming so there is a more intuitive movement 
                        between pages. During the interview, my interviewees highlighted that they liked the simplicity of the page. Afterall a shopping application
                        should not have the colorful attractiveness of a social media application. They also highlighted that they liked most of the flow functionality, 
                        saying that most of it was intuitive and easy, even if the buttons were not very clear. Lastly, they liked that there was not an abundance of
                        complicated information quickly, rather it was spread out over many pages. 
                        
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        In order to incorporate the information that I gained from the UX evaluation, I changed several aspects of prototype II. The first thing I changed was 
                        color scheme. Due to the darker background, it was difficult to see the black buttons, as highlighted in the previous paragraph. I changed the background 
                        to be white so that the black buttons would stand out much more! The second thing I changed was the flow functionality. Instead of having many complicated 
                        flows that led in loops, I aimed for a simpler design that has more deadends that you navigate backwards from. This greatly improved the intuition of the flow. 
                        Also to this point, I made titles of pages more clear, such as emphasizing "profile" on the profile page. Lastly, I added a slight flair of color in the name near 
                        the top of each page. As highlighted by my interviewees, the store should not be overly colorful since it is just for shopping, but should have something colorful
                        in order to remember the page.
